This portfolio site was made for ComS 494 at Iowa State University.
The site theme is based on the [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/home/) template
[jekyllDecent]().

Installation instructions, features, previews and more can be found in
the **[GitHub generated blog](https://github.com/jwillmer/jekyllDecent)**. This blog
