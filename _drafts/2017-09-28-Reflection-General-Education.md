## General Education Reflection Requirements

Please describe how your General Education Courses helped you to develop as a professional
engineer. Write a reflection that incorporates your thoughts on each of the following questions.

- **GE1** What are your current short/long term goals? You may include your “ideal” career in
  engineering or your preferred working environment.
- **GE2** What have you learned in your general education electives, which allow you to formulate
  and evaluate engineering solutions in problem solving and innovation beyond the technical
  aspects in problem solving? How do general education classes help you to think about an
  engineering problem? 
- **GE3**  Relate what you have learned in general education classes to seeing beyond the
  engineering solution in problem solving and innovation. What are some other dimensions
  to consider and what impact do they have in an economic, global or societal context?
