There is a tendency to develop software as a collection of managed micro-services. Often these pieces of
software are deployed to the cloud. The goal of our senior design project is to develop an environment to
facilitate development of Javascript-based micro-services that exhibit specific quality attributes, as well
as to create an automated devOps process for managing the development and deployment of these JavaScript
micro-services.

While everyone on the team contributes to the design and development of the product, my "specialty"
roles on the team are as Project Manager and Technical Writing Lead. At this point in time, we are still
in the research and early prototyping stage, but I will update this page as the project progresses.

## Resources

## Potential impact

TODO: How does, or might your Senior Design Project contribute to the solution of a
regional, national or global problem? Propose some specific ways.
