        <p>The “How Do Dinosaurs…” series is a popular choice among children and adults, and this entry covers the topic of sharing. In similar fashion as other books in the series, the first half shows all the bad behaviors on display by the dinosaurs, and the latter half shows how they should behave instead. The irascible and yet charming personalities of the dinosaurs really come to life in the hilarious illustrations that feature massive dinosaurs in an otherwise ordinary childhood world.</p>

        <p>The main character in the story doesn’t want to share his “house” (a cardboard box) with any of the other kids on the playground, saying such things as, “it’s not for girls,” or “it’s not for people with glasses.” He changes his mind at the end when he is excluded from the fun because he has red hair, upon which he sees that the house belongs not to him but to everyone. In addition to talking about sharing, the book offers the opportunity to talk to your kids about discrimination.</p>
