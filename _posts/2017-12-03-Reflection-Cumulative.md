## First, a Word of Thanks

I have been tremendously blessed to have been able to attend college in
pursuit of my dreams; and not once, but twice! Consider these various facts,
and see if any of it makes sense. During my time at Iowa State...

1. My wife and I had 2 kids within 14 months of each other.
2. We bought a house.
3. We started a small business from scratch.
4. Aside from paid summer internships, I didn't really have to work during my
   time at school.

Wait... what? *How is that possible!?* Our friends and family would often
look at our situation and think, "How are they *paying* for all of this?"
Like I said, we have been tremendously blessed. God has had his loving hand over
our lives and has provided in every way imaginable.

The GI Bill benefits from serving
in the Marine Corps were a large part of that blessing, so thank you everyone
for paying your taxes and supporting our armed forces! I used to laugh at
those who joined the military just for the college benefits, but now that I've
been at the receiving end of those benefits, I can honestly say that they are
well worth enlisting for! Of course, it probably shouldn't be your *primary*
reason for enlisting, but... well, I'll just leave it at that.

Scholarships and grants from the government, from ISU, and from generous donors
also played a big part in funding my education and my family's well-being. God
blessed me with the ability to do well in school, and it didn't take long before
I saw a direct correlation between grades and funding. This brought the realization
that *doing well in my classes was more important than holding a part-time job*.
Thus, the decision to refrain from work was made. By focusing my time entirely
to my studies (as well as family), I could be a better provider financially to my
family in the short term, with scholarships, and in the long term, with better
job placement upon graduation.

Last, but not least, I need to thank my family and friends for their emotional,
financial, and spiritual support through everything. My and my wife's parents
have been tremendously supportive, and their gifts also played a large part in
providing for our family these past four years. Within our first year in Ames,
Ashlee and I moved *three times* (good grief), and there was always a crowd of
friends and family willing to help us do what nobody likes to help do! The
prayers, emotional support, and encouragement also helped us say afloat during
rough patches and difficult times. *So thank you everyone! You made us feel 
wonderfully loved!*

I wanted to start this reflection on a note of thanks, because it really is
by God's grace that we made it to where we are today. Any glance back over
such a tumultuous time of growth requires you to take stock of what you have
to be thankful for. If we lose sight of that, we lose a little bit of what it
means to be human. Knowing that your success is not your own is humbling, and
it allows you to have compassion on those who are not as fortunate.

## My ISU Journey

TODO

## Cumulative Reflection Requirements

Reflect on your 4-year experience at Iowa State University.  Remember to
highlight things like your ability to communicate, utilize your engineering
knowledge, and function within teams as well as what is highlighted below.
Here are some questions to answer as a part of your reflection: 

- **CR1.** How do you think ISU has prepared you to: 
  - Design systems or processes?
  - Formulate and solve engineering problems?
  - Impact engineering solutions in a global/societal context? 
  - Consider ethical implications of your engineering decisions?
- **CR2.** What things have you done at ISU to prepare you to:
  - Work in groups?
  - Recognize contemporary issues?
  - Understand professional and ethical responsibilities?
- **CR3.** In class projects & problem solving tasks, did you draw upon information,
  research or experiences beyond what was provided in class to successfully complete
  your work? Please state which resources here and how they helped you to complete
  work (e.g. library resources, specific professional journals, experts in field,
  other students). 
- **CR4.** How did learning activities outside of the classroom (required 124.5
  credits), such as Student Orgs, Career or Study Abroad Fairs, Undergraduate
  Research Experience (REU), or other university programs help you to understand
  the importance of Lifelong Learning? 
- **CR5.** Have you started to undertake any new learning to improve your ability
  to apply skills or knowledge to new problems and to develop confidence in taking
  risks? Please explain. 
- **CR6.** In the context of the first four questions, if you were to do your
  undergraduate work again, what things would you change?
